            "content": "This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full [‘British citizen’ passport](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality) from the UK, for the most common types of travel.  \r\n\r\nThe authorities in Austria set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, [contact the Austrian embassy in the UK](https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/austrian-embassy-london/about-us/map-and-opening-hours/).\r\n\r\n##COVID-19 rules\r\n\r\nCountries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel company or airline for changes.  \r\n\r\nIf you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.   \r\n\r\nYou should also read [TravelHealthPro's general COVID-19 advice for travellers](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/499/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice-for-travellers).\r\n\r\n##Passport validity requirements\r\n\r\nIf you are travelling to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the [Schengen area passport requirements](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm). \r\n\r\nYour passport must be: \r\n\r\n- issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’) \r\n- valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’) \r\n\r\nCheck your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. \r\n\r\nContact the [embassy of the country you are visiting](https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/austrian-embassy-london/travelling-to-austria/entry-requirements-visa-and-immigration/) if you think your passport does not meet both these requirements. [Renew your passport if you need to](https://www.gov.uk/apply-renew-passport). \r\n\r\nCheck with your transport provider or travel company that your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.\r\n\r\n###Passport stamping \r\n\r\nAt Austrian border control, you may need to show: \r\n\r\n- proof of your accommodation, such as hotel booking confirmation or proof of address if visiting your second home \r\n- proof of insurance for your trip – check FCDO’s travel insurance guidance \r\n\r\n- a return or onward ticket \r\n- proof that you have enough money for your stay  \r\n\r\nCheck your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Austria as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit. \r\n\r\nYou can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.\r\n\r\n##Visa requirements\r\n\r\nYou can travel to countries in the [Schengen area](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel: \r\n\r\n- as a tourist \r\n- to visit family or friends \r\n- to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events \r\n- for short-term studies or training \r\n\r\nIf you are travelling to Austria and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. \r\n\r\nTo stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Austrian government’s entry requirements. Check which visa or work permit you may need with the [Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/travel-stay/entrance-and-residence-in-austria/) or [Austrian Embassy in London](https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/austrian-embassy-london/travelling-to-austria/entry-requirements-visa-and-immigration/schengen-visa-application-requirements/) for visa requirements . \r\n\r\nIf you stay in Austria with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.\r\n\r\n##Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)\r\n\r\nAt least 8 weeks before your trip, [check the vaccinations and certificates you need on TravelHealthPro](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/16/austria).\r\n\r\n##Customs rules\r\n\r\nThere are strict rules about [goods that can be brought into and taken out of Austria](https://www.bmf.gv.at/en/topics/customs/travellers/entry-from-non-eu-countries.html). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.\r\n\r\n##Taking food and drink into the EU\r\n\r\nYou cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food needed for medical reasons. [Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animalproducts/personal_imports_en) on the European Commission website.\r\n\r\n",

            "content": "##Terrorism \r\n\r\nThere is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times. \r\n\r\n$E\r\nUK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on [staying safe abroad](https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/) and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out [how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad).\r\n$E\r\n\r\n###Terrorism in Austria \r\n\r\nTerrorists are likely to try and carry out attacks in Austria.\r\n\r\n##Political demonstrations\r\n\r\nDemonstrations may occur with little or no warning in cities. Avoid any protests, political gatherings or marches. Follow the advice of local authorities.\r\n\r\n##Crime\r\n\r\nCrime levels are generally low. However, there are higher levels of petty crime, particularly pickpocketing, in the big city centres and city parks after dark. Thieves use a variety of methods to distract people.\r\n\r\n###Protecting your belongings\r\n\r\nTake care on public transport and in crowded areas in city centres including main stations. Be particularly careful with your belongings on international trains to and from Austria, and when taking your baggage from trains and coaches.\r\n\r\n###Drink and food spiking\r\n\r\nDrinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers or leaving your drinks unattended. Victims of spiked drinks have been robbed and sometimes assaulted.\r\n\r\n##Laws and cultural differences\r\n\r\n###Personal ID\r\n\r\nBy law, you must have your passport easily accessible at all times. If you do not carry your passport, it must be in the same district as you and accessible within a short time. A photocopy of the data page of your passport can be helpful. A UK driving licence is not recognised as official ID.\r\n\r\n###Drugs\r\n\r\nDrug laws are similar to the UK. Possessing or trafficking drugs is dealt with severely.\r\n\r\n###Dress\r\n\r\nIt’s generally illegal to wear any clothing or object in public that covers your face. You could be fined up to 150 euro. See the [See the Austrian government website](https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/en/themen/leben_in_oesterreich/aufenthalt/Seite.120251.html) information on the law and a list of exemptions.\r\n\r\n###Public transport\r\n\r\nTickets on public transport must be validated in a ticket machine before you start a journey. Failure to do so can result in an on the spot fine of 100 to 500 euro.\r\n\r\n##Outdoor activities and adventure tourism\r\n\r\nHiking, mountaineering and other adventure sports can be risky.  \r\n\r\nCheck that the company is well- established in the industry and that you’ve arranged for your insurance to cover this specific activity. \r\n\r\nFor sports activities like skiing, potholing and mountaineering, and for sports classed as particularly dangerous (for example off-piste skiing, mountain biking, climbing, paragliding or BASE jumping), your [insurance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance) should include: \r\n\r\n- mountain rescue services \r\n\r\n- helicopter costs \r\n- repatriation to your country of residence or possible transfer to neighbouring countries for treatment \r\n\r\nCheck weather forecasts and conditions. Make sure you’re properly equipped for the worst-case scenario with items such as a map, compass, GPS and telecommunication equipment. \r\n\r\nRisks are greater if you undertake any activity alone. You may want to hire a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone.\r\n\r\n###Skiing\r\n\r\nRead FCDO advice about [staying safe while skiing and preparing for winter sports abroad](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/winter-sports-stay-safe-on-the-slopes). \r\n\r\nTake advice on weather and avalanche conditions before you travel and familiarise yourself with local skiing laws and regulations. \r\n\r\nOff-piste skiing is very dangerous. There are dangers of avalanches in some areas. Follow all safety instructions meticulously and go with a qualified guide. For more information about the avalanche risk, visit the [European Avalanche Warning Service](https://www.avalanches.org/) or the [Austrian Avalanche Warning Service](http://www.lawine.at/).\r\n\r\n##Transport risks\r\n\r\n###Road travel\r\n\r\nThere are complex driving laws in Austria, especially for caravan and motor-home drivers. If you are planning to drive in Austria, see information on [driving abroad](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad) and read the [RAC advice for driving in Austria](https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/austria/) and [overseas driving regulations for caravans and motorhomes.](https://www.caravanclub.co.uk/overseas-holidays/useful-information/compulsory-and-legal-requirements/) \r\n\r\nYou may also want to look at the [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/going_abroad/index_en.htm) and [Austrian government advice on driving](https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/en/themen/freizeit_und_strassenverkehr/kfz/10.html) in Austria.\r\n\r\n###Licences and permits\r\n\r\nTo drive in Austria, you must be 18 years or over with a full UK driving licence, and have insurance and vehicle ownership documents. \r\n\r\nIf you’re living in Austria or planning to live there check the [Living in Austria guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria) for information on requirements for residents.\r\n\r\n###Motorway travel\r\n\r\nAll vehicles on motorways, expressways and section toll segments in Austria are subject to tolls. If you use Austrian motorways you must display a vignette (sticker) inside your windscreen. You could be fined it you do not follow the rules. For more information [visit the Austrian Official Travel Portal](https://www.austria.info/en/service-and-facts/getting-there-around/by-car/vignette).\r\n\r\n",
